# Dance Salt Lake
Salt Lake City is home to one of the most diverse ranges of full-time and part-time professional dance companies. From Ririe-Woodbury, Repertory Dance Theater, Ballet West, Odyssey Dance Theater, and so many more, the professional and pre-professional dancer must wade and search through multiple sites each week if they wish to find out about a Class, Performance, or Audition. Add in Facebook's chaotic and confusing group system and you'll find that information on available events for dancers is sorely lacking.

That's where we come in. Dance Salt Lake displays all of Salt Lake's regional dance information for aspiring dancers throughout the valley. Individual Artists and Organizations may sign up for a secure account that allows them to easily input information and send the word out to the community. Our app cuts the confusion and presents the events in an easy to navigate single page application. Even if your Class, Performance, or Audition takes place over multiple days, our copy-event method allows users to easily duplicate and edit their events.

## Using the App
Our app has two pathways for use. Anyone can visit the website and see information on classes, performances, auditions, and spaces for rent within the Salt Lake City are. In order for there to be data, individual artists, companies, and non-profit orgnaizations can register and submit all of their data.

### Posting a Class, Performance, Audition, or Space
Upon registering, Users are brought to the protected usershome page where they can create, update, or delete their events. Our copy feauture makes it extremely easy to create an event with multiple times or dates. The same is true for classes which are usually ongoing throughout the month.

### Already being Used
Our app has had extremely positive feedback from the Salt Lake City area and we are already in the works to move to a national network for dancers.

### Logging Out
At anytime, you can log out by simply pressing "Logout" in the dropdown on the navbar.
